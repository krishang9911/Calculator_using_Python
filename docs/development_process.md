# Development Process

Steps followed during the creation of the Python calculator:

1. Wrote the basic calculator structure using Python in Visual Studio Code.
2. Added input validation to prevent errors from invalid or non-numeric input.
3. Implemented all four required operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
4. Added division-by-zero handling to prevent runtime errors.
5. Tested the program multiple times using the VS Code terminal.
6. Prepared project documentation and organized files for GitHub.
