# Project Overview

This project is a simple console-based Calculator built using Python.  
It performs four basic arithmetic operations: **addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division**.

The purpose of the project is to demonstrate:
- Use of Visual Studio Code for development
- Hosting a project on GitHub
- Creating and organizing a proper repository structure
- Writing documentation in Markdown
- Following basic software development practices

The calculator takes input from the user, performs the selected operation, handles invalid input, and displays the result in the terminal. This project is part of an academic assignment to practise version control and documentation.
